                            <h2>BrewTracker</h2>
                            <p> During the week, I currently brew beer for a production brewery in Austin, TX.  On multiple occassions, 
                                the flow of information between employees regarding equipment malfunctions or minor logistical complications leads to delays
                                in addressing and fixing problems.  Or, when there is an issue with the beer, diagnosing and fixing the problem because its own problem
                                due to a lack of consistent notetacking.  In hopes of solving these issues, I am building BrewTracker to give all employees involved in 
                                making the product access to a cloud-based app that records data for each beer and alerts all users in changes throughout each stage of a beer's lifecycle.

                                <p>     As the user logins, this is the homepage. Data is being fetched from the database, displaying
                                        the current condition of a tank. The user can see the status of each fermentation tank. The colors will be explained
                                        later.
                                        Also, the user can navigate to the "Brew Batch" page by clicking on the button.
                                </p>

                                <p>On this page, the brewer inputs values that he/she tracks
                                    during the brew process which then
                                    is sent to the backend database. Since the brew process can take anywhere from 6 to 8 hours, the app uses a
                                    continuous timer to send
                                     data every 30 seconds until the brew is done or if the brewer changes pages.

                                    <p>I'm currently working on this section; the fermentation tank.  The color of the tank represents the current stage of the beer from
                                            fermenting, to cold conditioning, to empty. The user can click on a tank to update the status of the batch which will alert all users.

                                <p>
                                    As all the main functionality is added to track a brew, I will then add a section called Historic Brews.
                                    In this section the user can pull up past batches and see all revelant metrics. Within this section, the plan is 
                                    to have options to compare multiple batches graphically. Also, I'm implementing react redux for state management.
